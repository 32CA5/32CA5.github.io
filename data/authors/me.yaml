bio: "I am a master's student in Mechanical Engineering at Huazhong University of Science and Technology. My research focus is on the design of precise mechanical structures and system integration. During my internship at Shenzhen Bay Laboratory, I participated in the development of the mechanical structure for the PET system for brain function imaging in a conscious state of mice. Focusing on the imaging stability requirements under the condition of conscious movement, I was responsible for and completed the structural design and prototype construction of the fixation, restraint, and movement mechanisms. Additionally, I have been engaged in DIY projects related to robots and mechanical systems for a long time, paying attention to the collaborative design of structure, control, and system."
